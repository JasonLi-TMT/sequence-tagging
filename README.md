# Named Entity Recognition with Tensorflow

This repo implements a NER model using Tensorflow (LSTM + CRF + chars embeddings).

State-of-the-art performance (F1 score between 90 and 91).



## Task

Given a sentence, give a tag to each word. A classical application is Named Entity Recognition (NER). Here is an example

```
John   lives in New   York
B-PER  O     O  B-LOC I-LOC
```


## Model

Similar to [Lample et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01360) and [Ma and Hovy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01354.pdf).

- concatenate final states of a bi-lstm on character embeddings to get a character-based representation of each word
- concatenate this representation to a standard word vector representation (GloVe here)
- run a bi-lstm on each sentence to extract contextual representation of each word
- decode with a linear chain CRF



## Getting started


check Entity_recognize.ipynb for more info




## Training Data


The training data must be in the following format (identical to the CoNLL2003 dataset).

A default test file is provided to help you getting started.


```
John B-PER
lives O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
. O

This O
is O
another O
sentence
```
